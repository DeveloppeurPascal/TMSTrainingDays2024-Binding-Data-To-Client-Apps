# Binding Data To Client Apps (TMS Training Days 2024)

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

There are many ways of exchanging data between software programs over local networks or the Internet. Let's take a look at some of them, using the technologies offered by TMS Software for Delphi. We'll be able to communicate between mobile applications, desktop software and Internet sites. This will also be an opportunity to see how you can use a web standard in your Delphi projects to feed an API that can be used natively in JavaScript.

This code repository contains the talk, the slides and my samples for the [TMS Training Days 2024](https://tmstrainingdays.com/) on Septembre 27 in Lille.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Talks and conferences

### TMS Training Days 2024

* soon

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/TMSTrainingDays2024-Binding-Data-To-Client-Apps).

The samples use thos packs from TMS Software:

* [TMS FNC UI Pack](https://tmssoftware.com/site/tmsfncuipack.asp)
* [TMS FNC Web Socket](https://tmssoftware.com/site/tmsfncwebsocket.asp)

You need to install them before opening the projects.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/TMSTrainingDays2024-Binding-Data-To-Client-Apps/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
