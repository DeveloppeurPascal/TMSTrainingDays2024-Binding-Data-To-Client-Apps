# Binding Data To Client Apps (TMS Training Days 2024)

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

There are many ways of exchanging data between software programs over local networks or the Internet. Let's take a look at some of them, using the technologies offered by TMS Software for Delphi. We'll be able to communicate between mobile applications, desktop software and Internet sites. This will also be an opportunity to see how you can use a web standard in your Delphi projects to feed an API that can be used natively in JavaScript.

This code repository will contain my samples et talk for the [TMS Training Days 2024](https://tmstrainingdays.com/) on Septembre 26-27 in Lille.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).
